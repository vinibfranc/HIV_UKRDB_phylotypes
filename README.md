Code for the paper "Evidence for Circulation of High-Virulence HIV-1 Subtype B 
Variants in the United Kingdom", which uses genomic and clinical (viral loads and CD4 counts) 
data from the UK Drug Resistance Database to investigate HIV-1 variants with increased virulence.

Individual-level HIV genetic, demographic, and clinical data from the UKRDB can be accessed for collaborative projects, 
subject to the approval of a research proposal by the UKRDB Steering Committee.

Provisionally, you can cite this preprint:

The analyses presented previously in the preprint were improved here, including, in particular, 
comparisons against other partitioning methods, enhanced viral load and CD4 decline models, 
and a new selection of VOIs. Despite these enhancements, the results remain largely consistent
with those reported in the preprint. The more robust and updated analysis reported here 
have been submitted to a journal.
