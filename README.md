Code for the paper "Evidence for Circulation of High-Virulence HIV-1 Subtype B 
Variants in the United Kingdom", which uses genomic and clinical (viral loads and CD4 counts) 
data from the UK Drug Resistance Database to investigate HIV-1 variants with increased virulence

HIV UKRDB genetic, demographic, and clinical data relevant for a project are accessible for 
collaborative projects upon approval of a research proposal by the UKRDB Steering Committee.

A more recent version of the analyses presented in this preprint was performed, including, 
in particular, comparisons against other partitioning methods, enhanced viral load and CD4 decline models, 
and a new selection of VOIs. However, the results remained largely consistent following these enhancements.
